# Forking the Repository
To create your own copy of the repository, you need to "fork" it on GitHub:

1. Open the [Open Filament Database repository](https://github.com/OpenFilamentCollective/open-filament-database) in your web browser
2. Find the "Fork" button in the top right of the page (below the search bar)

3. You'll be redirected to a menu where you can create your fork
4. If the owner menu says "Choose an owner", click it and select your username
5. Click "Create fork"

You should now see the same repository page, but with your username in the top left instead of OpenFilamentCollective. This is your personal copy that you can modify freely!
